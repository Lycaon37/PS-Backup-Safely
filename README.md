## About

This PowerShell script will back up folders on a Windows system using Robocopy. If you have ever forgotten in the past to back up important folders and subsequently lost them, this script aims to help. It reads from a list of folders contained in a file. It then copies those folders and their contents to the folder the script is running in as a backup. With a bit of work using the task scheduler in Windows, this could be set up to run automatically at preset times, such as every day at 8:00 AM, for example. Since it uses Robocopy, it provides fast, safe backups that easily run in bulk.

### Built With

- [PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) - Scripting Language
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Script Writing
- [PowerShell Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell) - Script Writing, Debugging
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - Media Creation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A computer running Microsoft Windows.

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 should already be installed on your computer. That will work just fine, but the menu to add folders will work better with PowerShell 7, which has a download link provided above.

- The PowerShell module [PSMenu](https://github.com/Sebazzz/PSMenu). To install PSMenu, open PowerShell and use the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module PSMenu -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases] section. Extract the provided .zip file into any folder you like.
Once the release is extracted, right-click on the file "New-Launcher.ps1" to generate shortcuts to launch the remaining scripts more easily. Once the shortcuts have been generated, it is ready to go!

**Note:** Please do not relocate the scripts after generating shortcuts. This will cause the shortcuts to break. To fix this, run "New-Launcher.ps1" again using the same method as before to regenerate the shortcuts.

## Usage

First, add folders to be backed up using the shortcut titled "Edit-List". Then, follow the on-screen instructions in the newly-opened menu to add a folder to the folder list. When done, press escape or close the window to exit the editor.

Once folders have been added, run the shortcut titled "Backup-Safely" to start the backup. It will then back up all the folders listed in the Folders.txt file. This file is what Edit-List add or removes folder paths from. Take care and enjoy!
